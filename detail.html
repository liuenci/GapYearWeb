						<h2>Her Gap Year</h2>
						<h3>Posted by micron News</h3>
						<p>Recently, a Girl shares us a lot of unbelievable experiences in her “gap” which is so fantastic that I am certainly touched by it. Mysterious and attractive, the land is characterized by contradictory temperament: she has suffered large amounts of pain but is still full of primitive strength and haunting simplicity.</p>

						<h2>The advantages of gap year</h2>
						<h3>Posted by micron News</h3>
						<p>One of the biggest advantages of gap years is that students will be more mature when they begin college. Most gap year participants will know how to be a good student, but they will lack quality life experiences. Gap years provide students with opportunities to interact with others, take on more responsibilities and become more independent.</p>

						<h2>The disadvantage of gap year</h2>
						<h3>Posted by micron News</h3>
						<p>Returning to college after a gap year can feel awkward. Your high school friends will be a year ahead of you in their studies and one year closer to graduation. Although most will be advanced academically, they may seem immature. It can be difficult relating to unfocused high school friends.</p>
