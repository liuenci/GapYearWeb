					<h2>Q&A: "The course itself has massively shaped me in terms of confidence"</h2>

					<p class="main-point_title">1. What first sparked your interest in drama/performing?</p>
					<p class="main-point_con">I've always had a huge love for storytelling and for people. I felt, from a young age, that acting and performing was an incredible way of telling peoples stories and of learning to understand others. Throughout school I kept myself busy in the drama department, trying to be a part of as many plays or media videos as possible! It was through the encouragement of my secondary school drama teacher that I really decided to take a career in acting seriously. With the support of my parents and with a lot of hard work, I decided to audition for drama schools!</p>
				
					<p class="main-point_title">2. What made you feel the need to take a gap year?</p>
					<p class="main-point_con">I'd auditioned for drama schools the previous year and didn’t get in, I began to realise just how competitive the industry really is and how hard you have to work. I really felt like I wanted to take this next step of auditioning seriously, really throw myself into auditions. I'd found it hard to balance the intensity of A levels and a Job with applying. So I decided to take the year out, to take my craft seriously, to fill my time with things that would hone my ability as an actor and to put my all into the auditions.</p>
